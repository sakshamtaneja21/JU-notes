Q5: Which of the following is true about linked list implementation of stack?
1. In push operation, if new nodes are inserted at the beginning of linked list, then in pop operation, nodes must be removed from end.
2. In push operation, if new nodes are inserted at the end, then in pop operation, nodes must be removed from the beginning.
3. Both of the above
4. None of the above

Q9: What does the following function do for a given Linked List with first node as head?
void fun1(struct node* head)
{
  if(head == NULL)
    return;
  
  fun1(head->next);
  printf("%d  ", head->data);
}
1. Prints all nodes of linked lists
2. Prints all nodes of linked list in reverse order
3. Prints alternate nodes of Linked List

Correct Answer:

10. Which of the following points is/are true about Linked List data structure when it is compared with array?
1. It is easy to insert and delete elements in Linked List
2. Random access is not allowed in a typical implementation of Linked Lists
3. The size of array has to be pre-decided, linked lists can change their size any time.
4. All of the above
Correct Answer:
