1. Write a C++ program to print out all Armstrong numbers between 1 to 50000. If sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself, then the number is called an Armstrong number. For example, 153 = (1*1*1) + (5*5*5) + (3*3*3).

2. A positive integer is entered through the keyboard. Along with it the base of the numbering system in which you want to convert this number is entered. Write a C++ program to display the number entered, the base, and the converted number. For example, if the input is 64 2 then the output should be 64 2 1000000. Similarly, if the input is 64 16, then the output should be 64 16 40.

3. Write a C++ program to generate all combinations of 1, 2 and 3 using for loop.

4. Write a C++ program to Print all the palindrome numbers from 200 to 300.

5. Write a C++ program to compute the real roots of a quadratic equation
	ax^2 +bx +c =0
     The roots are given by the equations
	x1= -b + (sqrt(b^2-4ac)/2a)
	x2= -b - (sqrt(b^2-4ac)/2a)
    The program should request for the values of the constants a, b and c and print the values of x1
     and x2. Use the following rules:
(a) No solution, if both a and b are zero
(b) There is only one root, if a=0 (x=-c/b)
(c) There are no real roots, if b^2-4ac is negative
(d) Otherwise, there are two real roots
Test your program with appropriate data so that all logical paths are working as per your design.
Incorporate appropriate output message.
