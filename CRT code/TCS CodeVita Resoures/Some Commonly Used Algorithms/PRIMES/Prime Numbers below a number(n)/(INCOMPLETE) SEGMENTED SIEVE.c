/*
Note : The idea works well for n upto the order of 10^7 only. Beyond this we will face memory issues.

LOGIC -
    idea is to store the Smallest Prime Factor(SPF) for every number. Then to calculate the prime factorization of the given number by dividing 
    the given number recursively with its smallest prime factor till it becomes 1.

Time Complexity -
    The precomputation for smallest prime factor is done in O(n log log n) using sieve. Where as in the calculation step we are dividing the 
    number every time by the smallest prime number till it becomes 1. So, letâ€™s consider a worst case in which every time the SPF is 2 . 
    Therefore will have log n division steps. Hence, We can say that our Time Complexity will be O(log n) in worst case.
